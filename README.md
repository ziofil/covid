Altair interactive visualization of current COVID trends. It generates new (absolute and relative) and total (absolute and relative) charts for the desired countries.

# Usage
1. Edit `covid.py` with the desired countries
2. Edit `covid.py` with the desired browser path
3. Execute `python covid.py` from the shell

# Example:

# TODO
Currently some countries may not work due to a name mismatch between the JHU and the worldbank datasets. I need to find which ones are off and fix them manually.
